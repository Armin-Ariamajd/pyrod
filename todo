get parameters for dist_dict, angl_dict from csd

switch pandas to numpy

additional functionality:
 - ar for aromatic interactions
 - pi-cation
    partial charges from OPLS 2005
    PHE: 6 * -0.115 = -0.69
    TYR: 5 * -0.115 + 0.15 = -0.54
    TRP: -0.57 - 0.115 - 0.055 + 0.075 + 0.13 = -0.685
         4 * -0.115 - 0.055 + 0.13 = -0.385

pharmacophores:
 - combinatorial library
   - limitation via max features
   - filtering via max_dis to geometric center
 - radius of hi, pi, ni
   - based on local minima
     - clip 0.000001
 - scoring pharmacophores via analyzing best (30) features in md

# list of lists to structured numpy array
    #grid = np.array([tuple(x) for x in grid], dtype=[(x[0], 'O') for x in
    #                sorted([[x, grid_dict[x]] for x in grid_dict.keys()], key=operator.itemgetter(1))])
    # clipping ionic interactions to minimum 0


Do features exist with very high score but tolerance below 1.0?
--> yes

put config parameters into seperate function

Should hydrophobicity only be calculated for water molecules not involved in a hydrogen bond?
--> yes (hydrogen bonded water molecules will have increased hi because of their high occupancy, compared to free water
         molecules)
